## What Can I Say
Having entered **Team LIMITI**, the robotics team of **UESTC**, since October 3rd, 2024, I've learnt `CAN` as well as `FDCAN` and tried to practice on `PID` while only having used the `P` term on the control of a micro servo **SG90**.  
*I mean*, I have only little experience of `PID`, letting alone coding a whole implementa of `PID` ~~though it's actually quite basic~~. However, given that I come from **the School of Information and Software Engineering**, where teaches **totally no** control theory but inclines to the **underlying implementations** *like the **Library Function***, I'm basically satisfied with such work.
